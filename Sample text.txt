Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud.
Blowzy night-frumps vex'd Jack Q.
Mr. Jock, TV quiz PhD, bags few lynx.
Crazy Frederick bought many very exquisite opal jewels.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.
